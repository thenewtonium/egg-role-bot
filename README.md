# egg-role-bot
A badly-written rolemenu bot designed for the specific usecase of Egg Society.

# Setup instructions
Put your botkey in a file called `erb-token.txt` in the same directory as `egg-role-bot.py`.
I recommend running this with `nohup`.
This code was developed for Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, with `discord.py` version 1.0 installed; I cannot guarantee it will work in any other environment without modification.
